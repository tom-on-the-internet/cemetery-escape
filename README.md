Cemetery Escape is a game that you can play in your terminal.

![Cemetery Escape](https://github.com/tom-on-the-internet/cemetery-escape/assets/8356936/7b0aa505-f43a-4928-8b0c-0a838a58e340)

You must escape the cemetery.
Search tombstones to find the key.
Then head for the door,
but watch out for ghosts.

## Requirements

- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
- A modern terminal with a dark color scheme

## Recommendations

This game involves a lot of running.

If your key repeat rate is low, or your repeat delay is high, you'll have a hard time.

I use:

```txt
repeat_rate=70
repeat_delay=200
```

How you set this up will depend on your OS and Window Server.
